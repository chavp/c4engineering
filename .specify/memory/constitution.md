# C4Engineering Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**Code quality is paramount and non-negotiable.** Every line of code MUST meet the following standards:
- **Clean Code**: Follow established patterns, clear naming conventions, and self-documenting approaches
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes require peer review before merge - no exceptions
- **Static Analysis**: All code MUST pass linting, formatting, and static analysis tools without warnings
- **Documentation**: All public APIs, complex algorithms, and business logic MUST be documented
- **Refactoring**: Technical debt MUST be addressed within the same sprint it's identified

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**Test-Driven Development is mandatory.** No feature implementation begins without comprehensive testing:
- **TDD Cycle**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced - tests written first, approved by stakeholders, then implementation
- **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 90% code coverage for all new features, 80% for legacy code improvements
- **Test Types**: Unit tests (mandatory), integration tests (for cross-component features), end-to-end tests (for user workflows)
- **Test Isolation**: Tests MUST be independent, deterministic, and able to run in any order
- **Continuous Testing**: All tests MUST pass in CI/CD pipeline before any merge

### III. User Experience Consistency
**Consistent, intuitive user experience across all interfaces.** Every user-facing element MUST adhere to:
- **Design System**: All UI components MUST follow established design system patterns and guidelines
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory - all features MUST be accessible to users with disabilities
- **Response Times**: User interfaces MUST respond within 200ms for interactions, 2 seconds for data loading
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with clear, actionable error messages in user-friendly language
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent behavior and appearance across all supported platforms and devices

### IV. Performance Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**Performance is a feature, not an afterthought.** All systems MUST meet or exceed:
- **Response Time**: API responses ≤ 500ms for 95th percentile, ≤ 100ms for 50th percentile
- **Throughput**: System MUST handle 10x current load without degradation
- **Resource Efficiency**: Memory usage growth MUST be linear with data size, CPU usage optimized for efficiency
- **Scalability**: Architecture MUST support horizontal and vertical scaling patterns
- **Performance Testing**: All features MUST include performance tests and benchmarks

### V. Maintainability & Technical Excellence
**Code MUST be maintainable for long-term success.** Every component MUST demonstrate:
- **Modularity**: Single responsibility principle, loose coupling, high cohesion
- **Dependency Management**: Minimal external dependencies, regular security updates, version pinning
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific configuration externalized, secrets management implemented
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and alerting for all critical paths
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup strategies, rollback procedures, and incident response plans

### VI. Security by Design
**Security integrated from inception, not as an afterthought.** All development MUST include:
- **Threat Modeling**: Security analysis during design phase for all features
- **Secure Coding**: OWASP guidelines followed, input validation, output encoding, authentication/authorization
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit, PII handling compliance, data retention policies
- **Security Testing**: Automated security scanning, penetration testing for major releases
- **Incident Response**: Security incident procedures, vulnerability disclosure, patch management

## Performance Standards

### Response Time Requirements
- **User Interface**: ≤ 200ms for user interactions, ≤ 2s for page loads
- **API Endpoints**: ≤ 500ms for 95th percentile, ≤ 100ms for median
- **Database Queries**: ≤ 100ms for simple queries, ≤ 500ms for complex operations
- **Background Jobs**: Processing time proportional to data size with clear SLA definitions

### Scalability Requirements
- **Load Capacity**: System MUST handle 10x current peak load
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatic scaling based on CPU, memory, and request volume metrics
- **Database Performance**: Query optimization mandatory, proper indexing, connection pooling
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching (application, database, CDN) with invalidation strategies

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Gates
1. **Pre-commit**: Linting, formatting, basic tests pass
2. **Pull Request**: Peer review, full test suite, security scan
3. **Integration**: End-to-end tests, performance benchmarks
4. **Deployment**: Smoke tests, rollback capability verified

### Testing Standards
- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage, fast execution (< 10s total)
- **Integration Tests**: Critical user paths covered, external dependency mocking
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for all major features
- **Security Tests**: Automated vulnerability scanning, dependency checks

### Documentation Requirements
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications maintained
- **Code Documentation**: Inline comments for complex logic, README files for modules
- **Architecture Documentation**: C4 diagrams, decision records (ADRs)
- **User Documentation**: Tutorials, guides, troubleshooting sections

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Development Gates
- [ ] Feature specification approved and clear
- [ ] Security threat model completed
- [ ] Performance requirements defined
- [ ] Test strategy documented

### Development Gates
- [ ] Code review completed by qualified peer
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, security)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Documentation updated and reviewed

### Pre-Production Gates
- [ ] End-to-end testing completed
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Performance testing under load completed
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested and documented

## Governance

**This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines.** All team members MUST:
- Verify compliance with these principles in all code reviews and architectural decisions
- Escalate any conflicts between principles and business requirements to engineering leadership
- Propose amendments through documented RFC process with stakeholder approval
- Use performance metrics and quality indicators to validate adherence

**Amendment Process**: Constitutional changes require:
1. Written proposal with impact analysis
2. Technical review by architecture team
3. Approval by engineering leadership
4. Migration plan for existing code
5. Updated tooling and CI/CD pipeline configurations

**Compliance Verification**: 
- Weekly metrics review against performance and quality standards
- Monthly constitution compliance audit
- Quarterly retrospective on principle effectiveness
- Annual constitution review and update cycle
