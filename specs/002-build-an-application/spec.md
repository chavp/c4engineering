## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Problem Statement

Engineering teams need a unified platform that combines **Backstage's service catalog approach** with **visual C4 model architecture diagramming** and **seamless local deployment capabilities**. Current solutions either provide service discovery (Backstage) OR architecture visualization (C4 tools) OR deployment management, but no single platform integrates all three capabilities with drag-and-drop simplicity.

**Business Impact**: 
- Teams waste time switching between multiple tools for service discovery, documentation, and deployment
- Architecture documentation becomes stale because it's disconnected from actual services and deployments
- New team members struggle to understand both service relationships AND technical architecture
- Local development environments are inconsistent due to manual deployment processes

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Platform engineers discover services through a Backstage-inspired catalog, visualize their architecture using interactive C4 model diagrams with drag-and-drop editing, configure deployment pipelines directly from container elements, and deploy services to local Docker Desktop for development and testing‚Äîall within a single integrated platform.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Service Discovery and Catalog Management**
1. **Given** an empty service catalog, **When** I import existing services from repository metadata, **Then** services appear in catalog with basic information, ownership, and dependency data
2. **Given** a populated service catalog, **When** I search for "payment" services, **Then** all payment-related services display with their current status, owner teams, and recent activity
3. **Given** a service in the catalog, **When** I click "View Architecture", **Then** the system automatically generates a C4 Context diagram showing the service and its relationships
4. **Given** a service entry, **When** I update its metadata (description, owner, tags), **Then** changes propagate to all related diagrams and views automatically

**Scenario 2: Interactive C4 Architecture Visualization**
1. **Given** a service from the catalog, **When** I open its architecture view, **Then** a C4 Context diagram displays with the service positioned centrally and connected external systems
2. **Given** a Context diagram, **When** I double-click on the main system, **Then** the view transitions to Container level showing internal application containers and data stores
3. **Given** a Container diagram, **When** I drag a new container from the component palette, **Then** the container appears with snap-to-grid positioning and I can configure its properties
4. **Given** two containers on the diagram, **When** I drag from one to create a relationship, **Then** a connection appears with editable labels for interaction type and data flow
5. **Given** any diagram, **When** I select multiple elements and group them, **Then** they form a logical boundary that can be labeled and styled as a system boundary

**Scenario 3: Pipeline Configuration from Architecture**
1. **Given** a Container diagram with application containers, **When** I right-click on a containerized application, **Then** a context menu offers "Configure Pipeline" option
2. **Given** pipeline configuration dialog, **When** I specify build commands, Docker registry, and deployment parameters, **Then** configuration validates against local Docker Desktop and service catalog metadata
3. **Given** a configured pipeline, **When** I click "Run Build" from the container's context menu, **Then** build process executes with real-time logs displayed in dedicated sidebar panel
4. **Given** successful build completion, **When** build finishes, **Then** deployment option becomes available and container status updates in both catalog and diagram

**Scenario 4: Local Docker Desktop Deployment**
1. **Given** a built container image, **When** I click "Deploy to Local" from either catalog or diagram, **Then** container deploys to Docker Desktop with health monitoring enabled
2. **Given** multiple deployed containers, **When** I view the deployment dashboard, **Then** all containers show real-time status, resource usage, logs, and interdependencies
3. **Given** a running deployment, **When** container fails health checks, **Then** system displays failure reason, suggests troubleshooting steps, and offers rollback option
4. **Given** successful deployments, **When** I modify architecture diagram, **Then** system detects changes and prompts to update deployment configuration accordingly

**Scenario 5: Cross-Team Collaboration and Service Discovery**
1. **Given** services owned by different teams, **When** I browse the service catalog by team filter, **Then** services group by owning team with contact information and responsibility areas
2. **Given** a service dependency relationship, **When** I click on dependent service in diagram, **Then** system navigates to that service's catalog entry and architecture views
3. **Given** architecture changes, **When** I modify service relationships in diagram, **Then** system updates service catalog dependencies and notifies affected service owners
4. **Given** deployment issues, **When** container deployment fails, **Then** system identifies dependent services and notifies their owners of potential impact

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Docker Desktop is not running during deployment attempt?
- How does system handle services that exist in catalog but have no architecture diagrams?
- What occurs when drag-and-drop operations would create circular dependencies?
- How does system respond when local Docker Desktop lacks resources for multiple service deployments?
- What happens when service catalog metadata conflicts with architecture diagram representations?
